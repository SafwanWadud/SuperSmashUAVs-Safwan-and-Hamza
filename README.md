Spot Check #1 - Jan. 5, 2019 
------------------------

The Purpose of this spot check is to determine if your team is on track and has started the summative. This is covered as part of the 15% planning phase of the summative. In this spot check I am assessing a 5% portion of this phase. You still have a further 10% to consider for the remaining check at the end.The following aspects are being assessed based on an agreed date of Dec. 31st to have started and/or completed the setup of certain features. Namely:

**Mindomo - Project Overview** - :+1: 

**Mindomo - Daily Notes** - :+1: 

**Mindomo - Flow Chart** - :+1:

**Tom's Planner - GANNT CHART in the PROJECT TIMELINE section** - :+1:

**Processing - Pseudocode** - :+1:  

* BUT A BIG POINT HERE** I was unable to run your program today. The code supplied in GitHub needs to be organized in such a fashion that I can download and play at any time to represent what is depicted int he GANNT chart.  That said, I tried to run the code from the Safwan Branch but couldn't as the .jpg files were missing.  e.g. If you have a data folder you will need to upload this as well to gitHub along wioth all the data files (.jpg, .wav etc.).

* Also, As you complete parts (described in GANNT chart), try to recommit those files to the master branch.  It is easier for everyone this way.

* No marks deducted at this time.
