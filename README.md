# ICS-Summative
Starting Summative Files

Details of the summative can be found inside the Mindomo project plan.

Ask for your copy of the Mindomo project plan:  **Copy the URL here: https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/8f895b73bb1b4ceec2259e8b7c7f9896 **

Use Tom's Planner to start a project plan using a GANTT chart: **Copy URL here:https://www.tomsplanner.com/public/hamzasafwan **
Be sure to password protect the chart but supply your password to your shared GANTT chart Here: 123

Firm Due Date: **Monday, Jan 21st, 2019**

More to come as details emerge.

Spot Check #1 - Jan. 5, 2019 
------------------------

The Purpose of this spot check is to determine if your team is on track and has started the summative. This is covered as part of the 15% planning phase of the summative. In this spot check I am assessing a 5% portion of this phase. You still have a further 10% to consider for the remaining check at the end.The following aspects are being assessed based on an agreed date of Dec. 31st to have started and/or completed the setup of certain features. Namely:

**Mindomo - Project Overview** - :+1: 

**Mindomo - Daily Notes** - :+1: 

**Mindomo - Flow Chart** - :+1:

**Tom's Planner - GANNT CHART in the PROJECT TIMELINE section** - :+1:

**Processing - Pseudocode** - :+1:  

* BUT A BIG POINT HERE** I was unable to run your program today. The code supplied in GitHub needs to be organized in such a fashion that I can download and play at any time to represent what is depicted in the GANNT chart.  That said, I tried to run the code from the Safwan Branch but couldn't as the .jpg files were missing.  e.g. If you have a data folder you will need to upload this as well to gitHub along wioth all the data files (.jpg, .wav etc.).

* Also, As you complete parts (described in GANNT chart), try to recommit those files to the master branch.  It is easier for everyone this way.

* No marks deducted at this time.

*Safwan - Due to the complexity & quality and the meticulous detail you strived to include each day both in the daily notes, the work on the hierarchy, and the final product too, I have decided to increase this to 85 for you.

Excellent work both of you.
